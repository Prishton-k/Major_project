# Non-Coder (Player) Perspective
- First Impressions: Simple and clean. Buttons and text are easy to understand. Smooth gameplay.

- User Experience:

- Start Screen: Clear options, but could show which mode you are in.
- Classic Mode: Fun and smooth, but Game Over could have more excitement (e.g., screen shake).
- Levels Mode: Good difficulty increase, nice background change. The "Congratulations" screen is nice.
Usability Issues:

- Buttons: "Restart" could be shown during the game. "Back to Start" should be available anytime.
- Game Over: Needs more feedback when you lose (e.g., shake or flash).
Sound: Good food sound, but more sounds needed (e.g., level-up, crash).

# Coder (Developer) Perspective
Code Structure:

- Good use of gameState and separate game modes.
- Snake class works well, but food and obstacles could be in a shared class.
- Improvements:{
- Collision Logic: Use helper functions and faster checks (Set/Map).
- Food Placement: Make it faster, maybe store positions in advance.
- Level System: Expand with more obstacles, use a Level class.
- Restart Logic: Separate resets for different modes.
- Visuals & Sound:Add effects like screen shake when you die.
More sounds for actions (level-up, crash).}
